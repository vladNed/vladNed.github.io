# DevLod #2: March 2022 Update

## 1. Intro

I'll make this blogpost because I have been slacking off from writing here. I
started posting more on my Instagram and also writing more in my journal, which
btw now has a lot of my memories in it.

As for now, I am still working at Settle building and constructing the future of
a payment app. Most of my dev time has been spent into integrations with various
services and providers which I will not get into details about.

## 2. Finding independence

This is not a section about mocking anyone or anything. It is more about telling
a story of how I felt that my mental energy was draining in minor things that I
could have controlled super easily but. I started talking and debating my journey
at Settle with one of the guys working there on product and found a lot about
myself to be honest.

So... for the last month I spent a lot of time, and when I say a lot of time I
mean 100% of my workday, working in pair programming. Pair programming is great
and its also a very good approach at solving problems a lot faster. What I
observed is that our pace went down very fast. We were to engineers working on a
problem very fast in our vision but in fact we were working at a very slow pace.

The time you had alone with your thoughts when coding was lost in favour of
discussing with your peer about solving an issue. You can imagine that this was transformed into a constructive debate at first and later at brainstorming a
tone of ides.

I realized that in that period I mostly lost the time to think problems through
by myself and giving myself breaks to actually process the thoughts. Because of
the constant processing of information with my peer I drained all my mental
energy. Later in the evening when we also had sync calls with others I was so
idle that I could fall asleep in just 2s.

## 3. Rediscovering my space

Not actually discovering MySpace...but more like discovering that I can actually
control my interaction with others in a productive way.

- Rejecting calls, huddles and meeting if I don't feel that my input is necessary
or if I feel like my energy levels are low.
- Taking notes at the start and end of meeting so we/I can have a clear conclusion
about what we discussed (this was not my idea but I liked it so I introduced it
in my routine)
- Taking breaks more frequently and giving myself some space so I can also
process information.

This kinda set a limit on how I want to actually treat myself and my mind. The
productivity grew exponentially. Now my colleague and I work in parallel on
a project and also have sync calls and do occasionally some peer programming but
I love this so much. It made the work day a lot enjoyable.
